TradePost is a game where you direct a robot fleet to fulfill the requests of a mysterious trading company. You get paid in fuel, which you also need in order to move and extract resources.

The infinite map holds myriads of resources. In the center of the map, there's a trading outpost, through which the clients request certain goods. In order to manufacture those goods, you need to gather and combine different resources.

However, it lacks one important resource - and that is energy. The nearby sun is too weak to provide it, so you have to rely on orbital rechargers. These rechargers, though, are owned by trading corporations - in order to get the energy from them, you should fulfill the request of their owners.
